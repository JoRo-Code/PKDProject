{- 
  We need to implement following, somewhere along the way:
* Handle the case when coordinates are out of range (incl. when any part's coordinates are out of range)
* Handle the case when ny ship part crosses another ship part already placed, 
  thus rendering the placement invalid.

{- 

When player1 is playing their action manipulates player2's array. What's being displayed should just be the states (and in case of ship, display in other way)

Drawing when it's player1's turn:
Go through the array and draw a cross at every element that is checked. 
If is is checked and a ship, display it in another way

Shooting:

If input is valid, update player2's array and call the draw func
